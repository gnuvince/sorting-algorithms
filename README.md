Sorting Algorithms
==================

Implementation of various sorting algorithms in OCaml.

Compiling
---------

    $ make


Running
-------

Run `bench.native`.  Use the `--help` option to view command line options.


Future work
-----------

* Add command-line option to select different types of elements (floats, strings)
* Add command-line option to generate charts of the running times.
* Implement other algorithms (timsort, introsort etc.)
* Add a test suite to make sure that all sorting algorithms are correct
